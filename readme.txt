NWT v1.3 Source Code Release
10/99 by Denis Moeller, info@dead-calm.net

I've been asked to release the source code of NWT a few weeks
ago and I've decided to search the backup CDs and discs for it.

Here it is: the complete source code of NWT v1.3 (the code of
NWT v1.4b is not available anymore, v1.4b was never finished
anyway). 

I think you gotta compile the parts by hand and use the batch
file to compile/link the whole thing with it. I used to compile
it using Turbo C v2.0 from Borland. It is C, NOT C++ code. Many
of the variable names are in german, as well as comments. The 
GIF save/load routines are from some SimTel archive I guess, the 
MUS player was made by Vladimir Arnost. See NWT's docs for 
details. 

The last time I touched this stuff is almost 5 years ago. So, see 
for yourself. 

Do NOT ask me for help, do NOT ask how certain things work in
the code - I don't know - in other words: this stuff is released 
as is, without ANY kind of warranty, support etc.

Have fun. :)
